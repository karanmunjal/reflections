--When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    
 When we want to share our project to the public or collaborating with other people, we use remote repository.




--Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
 automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    
 When we are adding a new feature, there would be a lot of commits. So it would be difficult to work on the new feature.




--
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    
 Cloning git repositories is fork, copying form github to computer is clone and adding a segment to the master is branch



--What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

   
 Let us take an example, if we are taking the flight, then it would be good to know the last known state of remote stored locally.




--How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    
 We can collaborate by doing all the project work together in the same office or at the same place which would be a lot difficult. Using github would be a lot easier as it makes collaboration with other people a lot easier.




--When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?


 When we have given a pull request. Directly merging the master saves time, but if we are working with collaborators then merging in the separate branch is a good option.
